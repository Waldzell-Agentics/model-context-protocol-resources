## üîç Introduction to MCP

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard designed to standardize how AI applications (clients/hosts) connect to and interact with external data sources and tools (servers). Think of it like USB-C for AI: a universal way to plug capabilities into LLM applications.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Consistent Interface**: Standardized methods for LLMs to access tools and resources.
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Empowers LLMs to interact with databases, APIs, local systems, and more.
- **Security & Control**: Provides structured access patterns with built-in validation and clear boundaries.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new capabilities via servers without modifying core LLM applications.
- **Modularity**: Develop and maintain specialized functionalities in isolated, reusable server components.
